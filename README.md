# Color Palette Maker

## Description

This is the front-end of a color palette maker app which allows users to easily
create, save, view and edit palettes, as well as view other users' palettes.

Technologies used to create this app include jQuery, Handlebars, Sass,
and Ruby on Rails.

This is a project I have had in mind for a while, and I built a simple color
picker as a test of concept. Coding the color palette picker for this app was
the most involved process but also the most rewarding.

My approach was to stick to a strict schedule (backend, frontend, necessary
tweaks) and to work on one feature at a time.

There are definitely parts of this project that I already can think of ways to
improve. I would like to revisit this concept once I know a front-end
framework, which I believe would make it easier to keep the front-end
components organized in a meaningful structure.
